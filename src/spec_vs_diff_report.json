  "summary": "Most requested radio-group changes appear implemented: per-control orientation is added to types/defaults and saved layout, radio selection emits events with option label + binary code, and UI changes are described for full-area clickable options. However, there are a couple of changes not requested (notably a new backend query).",

    {
      "description": "Added backend query method `getRadioGroupLayout()` returning `Bool` (always `true`).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest did not request any new backend API for querying radio layout/orientation; orientation is expected to persist via the existing layout save/load.",

      "description": "Create Control button now includes additional gating/tooltips and auto-close behavior based on initialization/runtime mode.",
