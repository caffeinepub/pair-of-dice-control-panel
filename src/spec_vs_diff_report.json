  "summary": "Frontend changes add a reusable HTTP POST helper and update button control interactions to POST the button’s 4-bit binary code on press and POST \"0000\" on release, with console warnings on failures. Most requirements appear implemented, but some release event coverage (pointer cancel/leave) cannot be fully verified from the truncated diff.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "On button release, handle pointer up/cancel/leave and ensure reset POST is sent immediately exactly once, with no later delayed reset send.",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt shows a release handler, keyboard key-up, and blur handling, but does not show the actual pointer event bindings for pointer cancel/leave (or pointer up) on the button element, nor explicit removal/cancellation of any prior button-specific delayed reset logic. The file summary claims these behaviors, but the truncated code does not provide direct evidence of the pointer cancel/leave bindings or any removed timeout.",
