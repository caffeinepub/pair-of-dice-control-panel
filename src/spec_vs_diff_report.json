  "summary": "Diff adds Linux/Raspberry Pi bundle packaging and runtime scripts plus GPIO event runner env/service examples and docs, but the provided excerpts are truncated and do not conclusively show that the bundle contents/launcher behaviors meet all acceptance criteria. Diff also includes substantial unrelated frontend control-panel feature changes not requested by the BuildRequest.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Packaging workflow produces a self-contained .tar.gz bundle including frontend build output, backend canister artifacts, launcher script, and Raspberry Pi helper scripts.",
      "reason": "A packaging script was added/modified, but the diff excerpt is truncated before showing the steps that copy frontend build output, include backend canister artifacts (WASM/candid), include the launcher/helper scripts, and actually create the final .tar.gz archive.",
