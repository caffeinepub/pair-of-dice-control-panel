  "summary": "The diff primarily adjusts global theming/styling (dark mode class on the root HTML element, OKLCH CSS variables, body styling, scrollbar styling, and fullscreen workspace-region styling) and wraps the app with a ThemeProvider/Toaster. It also introduces multiple control-panel behavior and data-model changes (notably radio-group orientation support and related UI/defaults) that are not explicitly part of the stated new-tab vs in-Caffeine draft mismatch requirement.",

    {
      "description": "Added radio group vertical/horizontal orientation support (new type field, defaults, renderer behavior changes, inspector selector).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on making the New Tab draft match the in-Caffeine draft in layout/styling/behavior; it explicitly lists changing radio-group behavior/orientation as a non-goal beyond what is necessary, and the diff introduces a new orientation capability and related UI/model changes without any explicit request.",

      "description": "Changed header behavior to render CreateControlButton unconditionally and adjusted fullscreen targeting to apply only to the workspace region via a workspaceRef.",
      "reason": "These are functional/layout behavior changes not explicitly requested; the requirement is about new-tab vs in-Caffeine visual/behavior parity, and the diff summary indicates additional structural behavior changes beyond explicit theming parity work.",
