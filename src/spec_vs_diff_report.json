  "summary": "Button press/release paths were updated to emit a single `gpioset -c gpiochip0 <id>=<state>` command derived from the control’s configured code with validation and console warnings, but the Raspberry Pi runner documentation update is not evidenced in the diff. The diff also introduces HTTP POST side-effects not requested.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-4",
      "requirement": "Update Raspberry Pi bash runner documentation to reflect that button events now emit single `gpioset -c gpiochip0 <id>=<state>` commands on press and release (state=1 press, state=0 release) and no longer emit 4-line pin-mapping sequences.",
      "reason": "No changes to `frontend/docs/rpi-bash-runner.md` are shown in the diff summary; only 5 files were modified and that doc file is not among them.",
      "evidence": [

      "description": "Send HTTP POST requests on button press (`sendGpioPost(control.binaryCode)`) and on release reset (`sendGpioPost('0000')`), with a once-per-press guard.",
      "reason": "BuildRequest focuses on emitted event.value command string changes and helper updates; it does not request adding HTTP POST side-effects for button interactions.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/components/control-panel/ControlRenderer.tsx (imports sendGpioPost; calls sendGpioPost(control.binaryCode) on press; sendGpioPost('0000') on release)"
